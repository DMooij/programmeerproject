# Purpose

Since the rise of fitgirls, avocados have become a very popular food. However, the circumstances in Europe are unsuitable for avocado farming, which is why large amounts of avocados are imported throughout the year from avocado producing countries such as Mexico and Peru. As avocados are a superfood and considered to be very healthy, it is interesting to try and find a connection between the amount of avocados imported by a country for consumption and the health perception of its inhabitants.  

This project aims to visualize the amount of avocados imported and exported in Europe in the time period 2010-2015 and to explore the connection between the amount of avocados consumed by a countries inhabitants and their health perception.
