# Purpose
Since the rise of fitgirls, avocados have become a very popular food. However, the circumstances in Europe are unsuitable for avocado farming, which is why large amounts of avocados are imported throughout the year from avocado producing countries such as Mexico and Peru. As avocados are a superfood and considered to be very healthy, it is interesting to try and find a connection between the amount of avocados imported by a country for consumption and the health perception of its inhabitants.  

This project aims to visualize the amount of avocados imported and exported in Europe in the time period 2010-2015 and to explore the connection between the amount of avocados consumed by a countries inhabitants and their health perception. The project is aimed at people with an interest in health and nutrition.

# Features
The webpage is initialized with a map of Europe, a barchart and a donut chart. On the map the European countries are coloured in different shades of green, reflecting the amount of avocados the country imports/exports (what is shown depends on what is selected from a checkbox). On hovering over a country the exact amount of avocados imported/exported is shown. On click on a country the two other graphs are updated to show data of the selected country. The barchart shows the amount of avocados consumed per inhabitant in the period 2010-2015. The donut chart displays the health perception indicated as percentage of one of the 3 categories bad/very bad - fair - good/very good. This chart can be updated according to gender (total/male/female) using a dropdown menu. Finally, the webpage features a slider to select a year for the data of the map and donut chart.
