# Problem

Since the rise of fitgirls, avocados have become a very popular food. However, the production of avocados is limited by environmental circumstances resulting in a higher demand for avocados than can be produced. Also the production of avocados has a great impact on the environment as for instance a lot of water is required to produce avocados. This project aims to visualize the production avocados in the world over the last five years.

# Features

The webpage is initialized with a worldmap. On this worldmap avocado producing countries are coloured according to the tonnes of avocados they produce in a year. 3 different colours will be used to differentiate between high - medium - low production. The datamap will include a dropdown menu in which a year can be selected and the map will be updated accordingly. On hovering over a country the number of tonnes of avocados produced is shown in a tooltip as well as the worldwide total consumption of avocados in that year and what percentage of this total is produced in the country. On click the environmental impact that avocado farming has is shown in a barchart. Also a calendar graph appears showing how the production price of avocados varies per month. All these features will be part of the minimum viable product, extra features might be added depending on how the project progresses.

See sketch in doc folder

The hardest part for now is that I still need to figure out a way to link the local production and worldwide consumption in a better visualisation. Also the linking between the visualisation needs to be improved.
