##Comments:
- Level 2
- Functions have comments but within the function the blocks don't have comments  

##Names:
- Level 4
- Clear names and the proper use of camelcase to name the functions and variables

##Formatting:
- Level 3
- Tabs not always in line and a few semicolons missing but mostly good

##Organization:
- Level 3
- Code is properly and clearly ordered and has a clear structure. Different files for functions that belong together and no code in comments.

##Flow:
- Level 2
- Lots of nested functions. Better to call the functions after one another.

##Idiom:
- Level 3
- Libraries in world map properly used.

##Structure:
- Level 4
- Good structure, easy to understand.
